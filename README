Here we our goal is to learn to create a local server using nodejs, parsing data from an input field, then buffering it and converting it into a string.

We also create three routes
-our '/' is our home route it includes a greeting and an input field that POST into our '/create-user'
-we created '/users' to demonstrate how we can create different routes and use them in our browser
- '/create-user' is where our input from '/' is posted and where we parsed, buffered and converted to string so we could view it on our console log
